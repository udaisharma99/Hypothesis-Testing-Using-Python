# Hypothesis-Testing-Using-Python

Problem Statement:

We aimed to determine if a Light Theme or a Dark Theme would be more effective for a website by analyzing user behavior through A/B testing. Evaluating user interaction with the themes would help us understand which theme fosters higher engagement and potentially leads to a better user experience and improved website performance.

Methodology:

We conducted hypothesis testing on four key website performance metrics:

Click-Through Rate (CTR): How often users click on an element after viewing it.

Conversion Rate: The percentage of users who complete a desired action (e.g., purchase, sign-up).

Bounce Rate: The percentage of visitors who leave after viewing only one page.

Scroll Depth: How far down a webpage a user scrolls.

We employed a two-sample t-test to compare the means of these metrics for users who interacted with the Light Theme and those who interacted with the Dark Theme.

Results:

Conclusion: 

While the Dark Theme appears to have a slight edge in terms of encouraging clicks, user behavior seems comparable for other website performance metrics.
