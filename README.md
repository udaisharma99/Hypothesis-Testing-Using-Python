A/B Testing: 

Light Theme vs. Dark Theme
This document summarizes the findings of an A/B testing experiment comparing a Light Theme and a Dark Theme for a website. We investigated user behavior metrics to understand which theme might be more effective.

Methodology:

We conducted hypothesis testing on four key website performance metrics:

Click-Through Rate (CTR): How often users click on an element after viewing it.
Conversion Rate: The percentage of users who complete a desired action (e.g., purchase, sign-up).
Bounce Rate: The percentage of visitors who leave after viewing only one page.
Scroll Depth: How far down a webpage a user scrolls.
We employed a two-sample t-test to compare the means of these metrics for users who interacted with the Light Theme and those who interacted with the Dark Theme.

Results:

Conclusion: 

While the Dark Theme appears to have a slight edge in terms of encouraging clicks, user behavior seems comparable for other website performance metrics.
